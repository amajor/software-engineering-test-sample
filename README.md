# Unit Test Example

> Using any programming language that you know, write a function/method that accepts a list of positive integers as a parameter and returns the sum of the numbers in that list. Using an appropriate test framework, write automated tests to test that function. Make sure that your program returns an error if the list is empty or if some members of the list are not positive integers.

- [x] Positive Integers
- [x] Input a List (of Positive Integers)
- [x] Sum of Numbers
- [x] Return error for Empty List
- [x] Return error for non-positive integers
